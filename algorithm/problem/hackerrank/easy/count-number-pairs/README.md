# Count Number Pairs

> HackerRank · Easy

## Problem Statement

Given a sorted array of positive integers and a target value, count the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j and array[i] + array[j] <= target.

**Example**

Input:

```
prices = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
budget = 7
```

Output:

```
8
```

Explanation:

We need pairs (i, j) with i < j and prices[i] + prices[j] ≤ 7. List all pairs:

- (1, 2) = 3 ≤ 7
- (1, 3) = 4 ≤ 7
- (1, 4) = 5 ≤ 7
- (1, 5) = 6 ≤ 7
- (2, 3) = 5 ≤ 7
- (2, 4) = 6 ≤ 7
- (2, 5) = 7 ≤ 7
- (3, 4) = 7 ≤ 7

Pairs like (3,5)=8, (4,5)=9 exceed the budget. Total valid pairs = 8.

## Input Format

The input is provided in two lines:

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and budget, where:

- 0 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ budget ≤ 10^9

The second line contains n space-separated integers `prices[0], prices[1], ..., prices[n-1]`, where:

- 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n
- prices is sorted in non-decreasing order

## Constraints

- 0 ≤ prices.length ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < prices.length
- prices is sorted in non-decreasing order
- 1 ≤ budget ≤ 10^9
- All inputs are integers

## Output Format

Output a single integer representing the total count of unique index pairs (i, j) with 0 ≤ i < j < n such that prices[i] + prices[j] ≤ budget. If n < 2, output 0.
