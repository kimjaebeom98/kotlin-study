# Two Sum

> HackerRank · Easy

## Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers and a target integer, return the indices of two elements that sum to the target or [-1, -1] if no such pair exists.

**Example 1**

Input:

```
taskDurations = [2, 7, 11, 15]
slotLength = 9
```

Output:

```
[0, 1]
```

Explanation:

We look for two durations that sum to the slotLength. Starting with index 0 (2), we need 7 (9-2). At index 1, duration is 7. Thus indices [0, 1] sum to 9.

**Example 2**

Input:

```
taskDurations = [1, 2, 3, 4]
slotLength = 8
```

Output:

```
[-1, -1]
```

Explanation:

No two durations in the list sum to 8. All pairs are: 1+2=3, 1+3=4, 1+4=5, 2+3=5, 2+4=6, 3+4=7. None match 8.

## Input Format

The input consists of three lines:

- An integer n, the number of tasks (0 <= n <= 1000).
- n space-separated positive integers: `taskDurations[0], taskDurations[1], ..., taskDurations[n-1]` (each between 1 and 1,000,000).
- An integer slotLength, the desired sum of two task durations (1 <= slotLength <= 2,000,000).

## Constraints

- Let n = taskDurations.length
- `0 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= taskDurations[i] <= 1000000` for all `0 <= i < n`
- `1 <= slotLength <= 2000000`
- Indices are 0-based
- If a solution exists, return two distinct indices i, j such that `0 <= i < j < n` and `taskDurations[i] + taskDurations[j] = slotLength`
- If no valid pair exists, return `[-1, -1]`

## Output Format

Print two space-separated integers i and j (0 <= i < j < n) representing the indices of the two tasks whose durations sum exactly to slotLength. If multiple valid pairs exist, any one may be printed. If no valid pair exists, print "-1 -1".
