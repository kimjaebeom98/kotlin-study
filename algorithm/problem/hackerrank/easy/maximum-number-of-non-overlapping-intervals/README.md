# Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Intervals

> HackerRank · Easy

## Problem Statement

Given an array of intervals where each interval has a start and end time, return the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals.

### Examples

**Example 1**

Input:

```
meetings = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 3]]
```

Output:

```
3
```

Explanation:

- Step 1: Sort meetings by end time → [[1,2],[2,3],[1,3],[3,4]].
- Step 2: Select [1,2] (count=1, last_end=2).
- Step 3: [2,3] has start 2 ≥ 2, select (count=2, last_end=3).
- Step 4: [1,3] start 1 < 3, skip.
- Step 5: [3,4] start 3 ≥ 3, select (count=3). Result = 3.

**Example 2**

Input:

```
meetings = [[0, 5], [0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 5], [4, 6]]
```

Output:

```
4
```

Explanation:

- Step 1: Sort by end time → [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,5],[0,5],[4,6]].
- Step 2: Select [0,1] (count=1, end=1).
- Step 3: [1,2] (count=2, end=2).
- Step 4: [2,3] (count=3, end=3).
- Step 5: [3,5] (count=4, end=5). Skip [0,5] and [4,6] because their start times are before last_end=5. Result = 4.

## Input Format

- The first line contains a single integer, `meetings_rows`, representing the total number of meetings.
- The second line contains a single integer, `meetings_columns`, representing the number of properties for each meeting (typically 2 for a start and end time).
- The next `meetings_rows` lines describe the meetings. Each line contains `meetings_columns` space-separated integers, representing the properties of a single meeting.

```
6
2
1 2
3 4
0 6
5 7
8 9
5 9
```

**Explanation**:

- The first line, `6`, is the value for `meetings_rows`.
- The second line, `2`, is the value for `meetings_columns`.
- The following 6 lines represent the individual meetings, which are parsed into a 2D list: `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [0, 6], [5, 7], [8, 9], [5, 9]]`.

## Constraints

- `0 <= meetings.length <= 1000`
- `meetings[i].length == 2` for all `0 <= i < meetings.length`
- `0 <= meetings[i][0] < meetings[i][1] <= 10^9`
- All start and end times are integers
- Meetings may share start or end times

## Output Format

- Return a single integer denoting the maximum number of non-overlapping meetings that can be scheduled.
