# Remove Elements Within K Distance

> HackerRank · Easy

## Problem Statement

Given a non-decreasing array of integers and an integer K, remove in-place any element that is within K of the previous kept element and return the new length. Use constant extra space and single pass with two pointers.

**Example**

Input:

```
timestamps = [1, 2, 3, 8, 10]
K = 3
```

Output:

```
2
```

Explanation:

- We start by keeping the first timestamp 1.
- Next, 2 − 1 = 1 < 3, so 2 is removed.
- Next, 3 − 1 = 2 < 3, so 3 is removed.
- Next, 8 − 1 = 7 ≥ 3, so we keep 8.
- Finally, 10 − 8 = 2 < 3, so 10 is removed.
- The remaining timestamps are [1, 8], so the new length is 2.

## Input Format

- First line contains two space-separated integers N and K, where `0 ≤ N ≤ 1000` and `0 ≤ K ≤ 10^9`.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers `timestamps[0..N-1]`, each satisfying `0 ≤ timestamps[i] ≤ 10^9` and the sequence is non-decreasing (`timestamps[i] ≤ timestamps[i+1]` for `0 ≤ i < N-1`).

## Constraints

- `0 <= timestamps.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= timestamps[i] <= 10^9` for all `0 <= i < timestamps.length`
- `timestamps[i] <= timestamps[i+1]` for all `0 <= i < timestamps.length - 1`
- `0 <= K <= 10^9`

## Output Format

A single integer L, representing the new length of the timestamps array after retaining only those timestamps that are at least K seconds apart from the previous kept timestamp.
